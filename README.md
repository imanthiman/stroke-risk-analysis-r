# Stroke Risk Analysis in R  
Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

This project explores clinical, demographic, and lifestyle factors associated with stroke using a public Kaggle dataset. The entire workflow was completed in **R**, following the Google Data Analytics framework (Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act).

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Cleaning and preprocessing real-world medical data  
- Exploratory data analysis with **tidyverse, ggplot2, janitor, skimr**  
- Statistical testing using **correlation** and **chi-square**  
- Building clear, reproducible visualizations  
- Translating data insights into clinically meaningful interpretation  

## Key Findings
- **Hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, and age** showed strong associations with stroke.
- **BMI, gender, and residence type** had weak or no meaningful relationships.
- Age had the highest numerical correlation with stroke risk.
- Smoking and heart disease were the strongest categorical predictors.

## Files Included
- `stroke_analysis.Rmd` — Full R Markdown analysis  
- `stroke_analysis.html` — Rendered report  
- `/data/stroke_data.csv` — Dataset used in analysis
